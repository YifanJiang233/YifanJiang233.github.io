  abstract = {This paper proves that, under a monotonicity condition, the invariant probability measure of a McKean--Vlasov process can be approximated by weighted empirical measures of some processes including itself. These processes are described by distribution dependent or empirical measure dependent stochastic differential equations constructed from the equation for the McKean--Vlasov process. Convergence of empirical measures is characterized by upper bound estimates for their Wasserstein distance to the invariant measure. The theoretical results are demonstrated via a mean-field Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process.},

  abstract = {This paper is dedicated to solving high-dimensional coupled FBSDEs with non-Lipschitz diffusion coefficients numerically. Under mild conditions, we provided a posterior estimate of the numerical solution that holds for any time duration. This posterior estimate validates the convergence of the recently proposed Deep BSDE method. In addition, we developed a numerical scheme based on the Deep BSDE method and presented numerical examples in financial markets to demonstrate the high performance.},

  abstract = {According to the recurrent frequency, many levels of recurrent points are found such as periodic points, almost periodic points, weakly almost periodic points, quasi-weakly almost periodic points and Banach recurrent points. In this paper, we consider symbolic dynamics and show the existence of six refined levels between Banach recurrence and general recurrence. Despite the fact that these refined levels are all null-measure under any invariant measure, we further show they carry strong topological complexity. Each refined level of recurrent points is dense in the whole space and contains an uncountable distributionally chaotic subset. For a wide range of dynamical systems such as expansive systems with the shadowing property, we also show the distributional chaos of the points that are recurrent but not Banach recurrent.},
