  abstract    = {This paper proves that, under a monotonicity condition, the invariant probability measure of a {McKean--Vlasov} process can be approximated by weighted empirical measures of some processes including itself. These processes are described by distribution dependent or empirical measure dependent stochastic differential equations constructed from the equation for the {McKean--Vlasov} process. Convergence of empirical measures is characterized by upper bound estimates for their Wasserstein distances to the invariant measure. Numerical simulations of the mean-field {Ornstein--Uhlenbeck} process are implemented to demonstrate the theoretical results.},

Under mild conditions, we provided a posterior estimate of the numerical solution that holds for any time duration. This posterior estimate validates the convergence of the recently proposed Deep BSDE method. In addition, we developed a numerical scheme based on the Deep BSDE method and presented numerical examples in financial markets to demonstrate the high performance.},

  abstract    = {According to the recurrent frequency, many levels of recurrent points are found such as periodic points, almost periodic points, weakly almost periodic points, quasi-weakly almost periodic points and Banach recurrent points. In this paper, we consider symbolic dynamics and show the existence of six refined levels between Banach recurrence and general recurrence. Despite the fact that these refined levels are all null-measure under any invariant measure, we further show they carry strong topological complexity. Each refined level of recurrent points is dense in the whole space and contains an uncountable distributionally chaotic subset. For a wide range of dynamical systems such as expansive systems with the shadowing property, we also show the distributional chaos of the points that are recurrent but not Banach recurrent.},

  abstract    = {A new class of particle systems with sequential interaction is proposed to approximate the McKean-Vlasov process that originally arises as the limit of the mean-field interacting particle system. The weighted empirical measure of this particle system is proved to converge to the law of the McKean-Vlasov process as the system grows. Based on the Wasserstein metric, quantitative propagation of chaos results are obtained for two cases: the finite time estimates under the monotonicity condition and the uniform in time estimates under the dissipation and the non-degenerate conditions. Numerical experiments are implemented to demonstrate the theoretical results.},
